* Tasks in queue
** TODO Design a simple yet more documenting hello world
** TODO implement XML and XSL view drivers

* Tasks completed in chronological order (reverse)
** TODO Make the config system environment variable dependent
   The presence of a given environment variable should be the deciding factor
on which group of configurations get used. This will allow for smoother
transitions between development, staging and production stages.
** DONE Reimplement the config system
   The config system should be PHP based, not .ini and it should be
   include()'d so APC can cache it and minimize disk hits for performance
** DONE Create an autoload class
** DONE Migrate the __autoload lazy loading to SPL
